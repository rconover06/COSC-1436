	Description: The program will generate 2d6 roll. On the first roll If the sum is 7 or 11 the 
		player wins and loses on a sum of 2, 3, or 12. If the sum is 4,5,6,8,9,10 on the first 
		throw that number becomes "the point". If you do not win or lose on the first throw 
		continue to roll until "the point" is rolled again (to win) or a 7 is rolled (to lose).
